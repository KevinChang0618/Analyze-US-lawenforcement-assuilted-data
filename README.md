1. What data are we analyzing?  

We analyze the US lawenforcement assuilted data from 1995 to 2018. We analyze this data to allow other who have interest about the US lawenforcement assuilted incidents for further studies.  Also, we analyze the overall lawenforcement assult cases situations, such as finding out the trend of increasing crime number while increasing the year or not, the case number of each state in each year, what weapon caused more casualties, and whether the timezone(day or night) influenced the number of crime  or not, to allow us more understand the situations of us lawenforecement assult.   

2. What does the Shiny app do?  

Our Shiny app shows the trend of the year to crime number in each state to compare to the whole states's, a map with assult case number of each state in each year, statistics analysis of significant difference between the crime number to day time and to night time, and what weapon used in crime more.  

3. What scripts are run in the analysis folder?  

We use  R markdown to tidy the data into other forms that easy to analyze. We split data dependent on year, state, time and weaponkind.
